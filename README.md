# PHYSIOCARE
 A Physical Therapy Exercise Monitor with Fall Detection and Visual Feedback.

Concept:

PhysioCare empowers individuals undergoing physical therapy to perform exercises effectively and safely at home. It tracks movements using the MPU6050 sensor (gyroscope and accelerometer), monitors for falls, and provides real-time feedback through a TFT screen and LEDs.

Components:

STM32 Nucleo F746ZG Board: The development platform for processing sensor data and controlling functionalities.
GY-521 Module (MPU6050 Sensor): Tracks 3D acceleration and orientation for exercise recognition.
Touch Sensor: Serves as a start/stop button for exercise routines and fall detection acknowledgment.
Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module: Keeps track of time for exercise duration monitoring.
TFT Display (Choose a suitable size and resolution): Provides visual feedback on exercise routines, data, and timer information.
Multiple LEDs (Optional): Offer visual cues for exercise guidance and fall alerts.

Additional Considerations (Optional):
Buzzer for audible fall alerts.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for smartphone app integration (data logging, exercise history, fall notifications).
Pulse oximeter sensor for heart rate monitoring (more comprehensive health data).
Project Functionality:

Exercise Routines:
Pre-programmed exercise routines targeting specific muscle groups are stored in the STM32F746ZG's memory.
Users initiate routines with the touch sensor.
Real-Time Feedback:
The TFT screen displays clear instructions and animated visuals for each exercise.
Live data from the MPU6050 sensor (movement angles, range of motion) is visualized on the TFT screen.
Color-coded feedback or progress bars guide the user's exercise form and performance.
Fall Detection:
Accelerometer data is continuously monitored to detect sudden falls.
Upon fall detection, LEDs flash rapidly (and a buzzer sounds, if included), and a clear message appears on the TFT screen, potentially prompting user action or alerting caregivers.
The RTC module timestamps the fall event for later reference.
Timer Visualization:
The remaining exercise duration or rest periods are prominently displayed on the TFT screen.

BENEFITS:
Independent Exercise Monitoring: Patients can perform physical therapy routines at home while receiving feedback on form and progress.
Enhanced Safety: Fall detection provides an extra layer of security, potentially alerting caregivers or prompting user action.
Visual Guidance: Clear instructions, animated visuals, and real-time data visualization on the TFT screen promote user understanding and adherence.

Additional stuff:
User Interface Design: Consider the user interface design for the TFT display carefully. Use clear, intuitive icons and text to guide users through the exercise routines. Ensure that the information is displayed prominently and is easy to understand, especially for individuals who might have limited mobility or visual impairments.

Exercise Database: Develop a comprehensive database of exercise routines targeting various muscle groups and rehabilitation needs. Include options for customization based on individual requirements and progress tracking. This database can be expandable, allowing for updates and additions over time.

Data Logging and Analytics: Integrate data logging capabilities into the system to track users' exercise performance and progress over time. This data can be valuable for both users and healthcare providers to monitor improvement, adjust therapy plans, and set goals.

Smartphone Application Integration: Utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for seamless integration with a smartphone application. The app can provide additional features such as remote monitoring, exercise reminders, personalized recommendations, and data synchronization with cloud storage for access from anywhere.

Accessibility Features: Consider incorporating accessibility features into the design to cater to users with disabilities. This may include voice-guided instructions, larger text options, and compatibility with assistive technologies.

User Feedback Mechanism: Implement a mechanism for users to provide feedback on their experience with PhysioCare. This can help identify areas for improvement and refine the system to better meet users' needs and preferences.

Battery Management: Optimize power consumption to maximize the device's battery life, especially for prolonged use during exercise sessions. Implement features such as sleep modes and power-saving algorithms to conserve energy when the device is not in active use.

Safety Certification and Compliance: Ensure that the PhysioCare device meets relevant safety standards and regulations for medical devices. Obtain necessary certifications and conduct thorough testing to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the product for users.

User Training and Support: Provide comprehensive user training materials and support resources to help users get started with PhysioCare effectively. This may include user manuals, video tutorials, and online forums for troubleshooting and community support.

Continuous Improvement: Plan for regular updates and enhancements to the PhysioCare system based on user feedback, technological advancements, and emerging trends in physical therapy and healthcare. Stay responsive to users' needs and evolving industry standards to maintain the relevance and competitiveness of the product in the market.
